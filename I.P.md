# I.P. Address

>An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique address that identifies a device on a network. It is a numerical label assigned to a device that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses are used to route data packets across networks so that they can reach the correct destination.

IP addresses are typically four numbers separated by periods, such as 192.168.1.1. 

Each number can range from 0 to 255.

So, the full IP addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.

>There are two main types of IP addresses: public and private. 
>Public IP addresses are used to identify devices on the public internet. Private IP addresses are used to identify devices on a local network.
>Public IP addresses are assigned by Internet service providers (ISPs). Private IP addresses are assigned by the device's network administrator.
>IP addresses are an essential part of how the internet works. They allow devices to communicate with each other and to be uniquely identified on the network.


### ***Here are some of the benefits of using IP addresses:***

- *Unique identification:* IP addresses provide a unique identifier for each device on a network. This allows devices to communicate with each other and to be uniquely identified on the network.
- *Routing:* IP addresses are used to route data packets across networks so that they can reach the correct destination.
- *Security:* IP addresses can be used to implement security measures, such as firewalls and access control lists.

### ***Here are some of the limitations of using IP addresses:***

- *Spoofing:* IP addresses can be spoofed, which means that an attacker can pretend to be another device on the network.
- *Tracking:* IP addresses can be used to track the online activity of users.
- *Scarcity:* There are a limited number of public IP addresses available, which can be a problem for businesses that need to connect a large number of devices to the internet.

<sub>Overall, IP addresses are an essential part of how the internet works. They provide a number of benefits, such as unique identification, routing, and security. However, there are also some limitations to IP addresses, such as spoofing, tracking, and scarcity.</sub>
