# BASIC INTERNET TERMINOLOGIES

### L.A.N ->

>A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building. By contrast, a wide area network (WAN) not only covers a larger geographic distance, but also generally involves leased telecommunication circuits.
> LANs are typically used to share resources such as printers, file servers, and internet connections. They can also be used to connect computers together so that they can communicate with each other.

***There are many different types of LANs, but some of the most common include:***

- *Client-server LAN:* In a client-server LAN, a single server connects to multiple devices known as clients. The server provides resources such as file sharing, printing, and internet access to the clients.
- *Peer-to-peer (P2P) LAN:* In a peer-to-peer LAN, all devices are equal and can share resources with each other. This type of LAN is often used in small home networks.
- *Token ring LAN:* A token ring LAN is a type of LAN that uses a token to control access to the network. The token is passed from device to device, and only the device that has the token can transmit data.
- *Token bus LAN:* A token bus LAN is similar to a token ring LAN, but it uses a bus topology instead of a ring topology.

### M.A.N ->

> A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that connects computers and other devices within a metropolitan area, such as a city or a town. M.A.N.s typically cover a larger area than local area networks (LANs) but smaller than wide area networks (WANs).
> M.A.N.s can be used to connect LANs together, to provide high-speed internet access, or to support other applications that require high bandwidth and low latency.

***There are many different types of M.A.N.s, but some of the most common include:***

- *Fiber optic MANs:* These M.A.N.s use fiber optic cables to transmit data. Fiber optic cables are very fast and reliable, making them a good choice for M.A.N.s that need to support high bandwidth applications.
- *Ethernet MANs:* These M.A.N.s use Ethernet technology to transmit data. Ethernet is a common networking technology that is used in LANs, so it is a good choice for M.A.N.s that need to be compatible with LANs.
- *Wireless MANs:* These M.A.N.s use radio waves to transmit data. Wireless MANs are a good choice for M.A.N.s that need to be flexible and easy to deploy.

### W.A.N ->

>A wide area network (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area. WANs typically connect LANs and M.A.Ns together, and they can also be used to connect devices that are not connected to any other network.
> WANs are typically made up of leased lines, which are dedicated connections between two points. Leased lines can be made up of fiber optic cables, copper cables, or radio waves.

***There are many different types of WANs, but some of the most common include:***

- *The internet:* The internet is the largest WAN in the world. It connects millions of computers and other devices together.
- *Corporate WANs:* Corporate WANs connect the different offices of a company together.
- *Educational WANs:* Educational WANs connect the different schools and universities of a country together.


    So,basically the Internet is a bunch of L.A.Ns connected by M.A.N, which are connected by W.A.Ns.

## NETWORK TOPOLOGIES :

### 1) BUS Topology :

    In a bus topology, all devices share a single communication channel. This means that all devices can see all of the traffic on the network, and they must all agree on how to use the channel.

### 2) RING Topology : 

    In a ring topology, data flows in one direction around the loop. Each device on the ring acts as a repeater, passing the data on to the next device.

### 3) STAR Topology :

    In a star topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. The hub or switch then forwards data to the appropriate device.

### 4) TREE Topology :

    In a tree topology, there is a central hub or switch, and then there are branches that connect to other hubs or switches. The branches can be either bus or star topologies.

### 5) MESH Topology : 

    In a mesh topology, each device is connected to every other device on the network. This means that there are multiple paths for data to travel between any two devices on the network.
